# MVRD_CNTRLR_2.0
Arduino based device for the remote control of ground and air robots using (XBox, XBee, i2c OLED, and USB Host Shield).

My goals with this project is to create an intuitive, expandable, self-contained, and affordable DIY alternative to traditional RC controllers. 

This started when I first became interested in multicopters. I found a lot of feature-rich Arduino based microcontrollers designed to be used as flight controllers, but everyone was still using traditional RC controllers and recievers that feed into those. Most of the high-end RC controllers are bulky and expensive, and they don't feel comfortable for use in air vehicles (to me).

The CRUIS AIOP boards have an optional expansion board that supports XBee cards. In additon to being two-way radios, XBees have a lot of useful features when you create a network with them, such as the ability to relay messages to each other. My intention is to utilize those cards and only communicate through the XBee radios.
